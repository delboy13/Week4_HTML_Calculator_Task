# Week4_HTML_Calculator_Task


## What was the challenge?
The challenge was to create a functioning calculator using HTML and javascript

## How i expected the challenge to go?

I though this would be a relatively easy task given we have covered most the topics in class over the week

## What went well?
Not alot, mainly because i think i have confused myself with everything done over the past 4 weeks. I, again, worked with other colleagues from the team to eventually get to the end product (although not quite what i wanted) and managed to get a functioning calculator in the end.

## What didnt go as planned?
I got quite confused with the stucture of creating the "table" to show as a calculator. The display screen for example was not lined up correctly.

## Possible improvements?
More revision in my own time and own pace to fully appreciate how object orientation works
